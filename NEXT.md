# NEXT — current state & kickoff

Living handover for this repository. Rules and shape: `../NEXT.md` (DONE or OPEN only, nothing
deferred; a bug found fixing item A is A's remainder, not a new item; this file holds ONLY what
to do next — completed work lives in `git log`). Plans of record: `PLAN_*.md` at this root.

## Open items

Items marked (Bn) are backlog rows in `BACKLOG.md`, which carries each one's full value
reasoning. Every item ends with a tag line: **Source** (backlog row, GitHub issue, plan doc, or
none), **Owner** (`Operator` for steps a workflow cannot do, `Claude Code` for steps a sub-agent
runs), and for Claude Code steps the **Model** a sub-agent should use (Fable > Opus > Sonnet >
Haiku; the lowest tier that fits). Anything touching code goes through a `claude/*` branch and
PR; the operator merges.

**Prod runs deployment prod-23d9a7e** (PR #359's merge deploy, run 36142304592, 2026-09-25; the confirmation statement activity is listed on ci only).
**ci**: `ci-set1` is last-known-good (built 2026-09-24 10:02 UTC by the b92 branch deploy) and the only ci set standing.
No pull request is open in this repository or its siblings.

The board runs in five sections, in this order: **in flight** (a branch, a pull request or a run
in motion, each named in the row), **machine-only**, **machine-ask**, **human-driven**,
**blocked**. The section is the classification — what it takes to carry the row to
completion, not who owns it now — so no row carries a separate tag that could drift from where it
sits. `machine-ask` is work a session drives end to end with a human present to authenticate or
approve: a second factor, an SSO login, a command the session's policy denies, a send from the
operator's address, a write to Google or GitHub the operator says go to. `human-driven` is work a
human must navigate themselves: a coding assistant's practical limits, a physical restriction
beyond one authentication (a proctored exam, a signature in person), or policy (a payment mandate,
a filing against the operator's own company, a decision between named alternatives). A row whose
only human step is merging its PR is machine-only; that is the standing workflow, not an action
the row needs. Within a section, items run by the size of the change to committed files, least
first (operator, 2026-09-13); a row that changes nothing committed — a comment, a run, a scan, a
console action — comes before any code. Operator items are briefed in
`../NEXT_OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md` at the workspace root, one file rewritten in place. Every item
names its model: the lowest tier that fits (Fable > Opus > Sonnet > Haiku), or `none` for a human
step.

Shared facts for the analytics rows (B52i, B52l, B52m): the prod Athena database is
`prod_env_analytics` and the workgroup `prod-env-analytics` (eu-west-2, `AWS_PROFILE=submit-prod`);
`OperatorSnapshotPublish.java` passes them to the Lambda as `GLUE_DATABASE_NAME` and
`ATHENA_WORK_GROUP_NAME` (lines 103 to 104).

## In flight

## Machine-only

- [ ] **SR-7. The batch verify runs the simulator behaviour suites the batch touches.** PR #353 went red three times (858 `test` and 797 `deploy` job-minutes, about 3 h) on failures only the simulator behaviour tier shows: a missing local table and SSM read, a sign-out that awaited a fetch before navigating, and the practice suite's old token. In `.claude/skills/do-next/SKILL.md` and `.claude/skills/iterate/SKILL.md`'s "once per batch before its first push" step, add: run `npm run test:<suite>Behaviour-simulator` for every suite whose routes, pages or helpers the batch changed (at least `auth`, `bundle`, `postVatReturn` and `practiceLicence` when auth, sign-in or practice code changed), serially after `./mvnw clean verify` and `npm test`. **Source**: session report jCZRKP. **Owner**: Claude Code. **Model**: Haiku. **Size**: 2 files.

- [ ] **SR-8. A CDK test that each handler's environment variables and SSM reads are wired.** Alarms #355 (a Lambda reading `SECURITY_STATE_DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME` that `ActivityStack.java` never set) and #357 (four Lambdas reading app-client-id parameters `DiyaGlStack.java` never granted) each cost 2 h 40 to 2 h 50 min on prod; unit tests mock both. Build one Java test over the whole-app synth (`SubmitApplicationCdkResourceTest`'s pattern) that, for each Lambda, reads its handler source under `app/functions/`, collects the `process.env.X` and `getResourceName("X")` names it and its imported `app/lib`/`app/data`/`app/services` modules read, and the SSM parameter names `app/lib/appClientResolver.js` reads when imported, then asserts each name is in the function's `Environment.Variables` and each SSM name is granted `ssm:GetParameter` on its role; an allow-list file for names set at runtime. **Source**: session report jCZRKP. **Owner**: Claude Code. **Model**: Sonnet. **Size**: ~3 files.

- [ ] **SR-9. `test.yml` skips documentation-only pushes to `main`.** 52 `test` runs on `main` this session (696 job-minutes) came mostly from `NEXT.md` and plan write-backs. Add `paths-ignore` for `NEXT.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `PLAN_*.md`, `REPORT_*.md` and `_developers/**/*.md` to `.github/workflows/test.yml`'s `push` trigger, leaving `pull_request` untouched so required checks still report on PRs; check that nothing on `main` depends on a `test` run per push (the `deploy.yml` delegation, `promote-ci-apex`, the scheduled runs). `prettier --check`, a js-yaml parse and actionlint with CI's flags. **Source**: session report jCZRKP. **Owner**: Claude Code. **Model**: Haiku. **Size**: 1 file.

- [ ] **SR-10. Performance gates are measured on the runner that enforces them.** B39a's floors were measured on a developer machine; 10 of 16 pages failed them on the runner and three extra compliance runs (about 122 job-minutes) recalibrated them. Add the rule to `.claude/skills/do-next/SKILL.md`'s brief list and `.claude/skills/refine/SKILL.md` pass 2: a gate or threshold a CI job enforces is set from runs on that job's runner, and a row that changes one dispatches the job and reads its scores first. **Source**: session report jCZRKP. **Owner**: Claude Code. **Model**: Haiku. **Size**: 2 files.

- [ ] **SR-11. A read-only script that names a cloud book's owner.** Identifying DIYA's cloud book took four operator pastes, because the session's own join of users to owner prefixes is blocked as personal-data handling. Commit `scripts/diya-gl-book-owner.sh <env>`: lists `prod-env-diya-gl-<account>` book prefixes (`aws s3 ls`), prints each book's title, product and period from its `metadata.json`, and each owner prefix's masked login from `activity_events` (the Athena query in the session report's evidence), read-only, for the operator to run with `!`. **Source**: session report jCZRKP. **Owner**: Claude Code. **Model**: Haiku. **Size**: 1 file.

## Machine-ask

- [ ] **CS-10d. The confirmation-statement price in Stripe test mode.** PR #352 put the £61.35 one-off price in the catalogue and taught `infra/stripe/stripe-sync.js` to create one-time prices, but nothing has run the sync: `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_FILE_CONFIRMATION_STATEMENT` and `STRIPE_TEST_PRICE_ID_FILE_CONFIRMATION_STATEMENT` are blank in every `.env.*`, so a ci checkout for the fee cannot open. With the operator's go (a Stripe write), run the `stripe-catalogue-sync` skill in test mode for this activity, land the test price id in the env files it names, and prove a ci checkout opens. The live price lands with CS-11. **Owner**: Claude Code with the operator. **Model**: Sonnet. **Size**: ~3 files.

## Human-driven

- [ ] **O11. The ITSA send day.** The proof is on `main` (PR #352, 2026-09-25): the eight ITSA suites pass on the simulator and run in CI, and the sandbox year ran clean on 2023-24, 2025-26 and 2026-27 on 2026-09-25 with a real `Gov-Client-Multi-Factor` header (`VALID_HEADERS`, no warnings), inside HMRC's 14 days until 2026-10-09. Send `_developers/hmrc/DRAFT_EMAIL_ITSA_RECOGNITION.md` to `SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk` from the operator's address once `main`'s deploy of PR #352 is green, then `_developers/hmrc/DRAFT_EMAIL_ITSA_PRODUCTION_CREDENTIALS.md` when SDST answers. **Source**: BACKLOG 11; `PLAN_ITSA_PHASE_2.md` T10. **Owner**: Operator. **Model**: none. **Size**: 0 files.

- [ ] **CS-H2. Send the confirmation-statement email.** Send `../DRAFT_EMAIL_XMLGW_CS01.md` on the `xml@companieshouse.gov.uk` thread, and paste the answers into CS-9's row. **Source**: `PLAN_COMPANIES_HOUSE_CONFIRMATION_STATEMENT.md` (its Tasks table carries the files). **Owner**: Operator. **Model**: none. **Size**: 0 files.

## Blocked

- [ ] **F-BS1. The 2026-27 company book's negative balance-sheet lines.** Cowork's check of `../staging/2026-2027/book/` (diya-gl 1.2.34, 2026-09-24): every check passes, but the published balance sheet shows trade debtors −£425.36 and trade creditors −£681.52, and net assets £1,337.3033 against shareholders' funds £1,337.3233 (2p). Causes it named: `BANK-2026-04-13-15-SUSPENSE` £527.41 (bank code DR; the 13 April "POLYCODE LIMITED, DL REPAYMENT" of the same amount is the likely pair); six "PAYPAL PAYMENT 5JX22222WZGH6" top-ups (£184.64) coded CR with no purchases line, which are transfers into the PayPal wallet; ICO ZB070902 £47.00 on 22 May with no purchases line although the label map (`../staging/labels/diya-labels.toml`) has an ICO rule; "Matthew Grundy, DIY ACCOUNTING" £70.00 on 22 April. Resolve against the operator's own reference set of accounts, line by line, then rebuild and verify with the `company-book` skill. Blocked on the operator's reference set of accounts. **Owner**: Claude Code. **Model**: Sonnet. **Size**: 0 files (the book and the label map are under `../staging/`, a label-rule or parser fix is ~2 files).

- [ ] **CS-H1. Companies House credit account: the account number.** The application went to
  `chdfinance@companieshouse.gov.uk` on 2026-09-24 (form at `../DIY Accounting Limited - CH account 2026-09-24.pdf`,
  email `../DRAFT_EMAIL_CH_CREDIT_ACCOUNT.md`), asking for the account to be linked to presenter E0000052288.
  Companies House takes up to 5 working days (by 2026-10-01). When the account number arrives, keep it in the
  credentials store and say so here; CS-9 then needs only CS-H2's answer. **Owner**: Operator. **Model**: none.
  **Size**: 0 files.

- [ ] **CS-9. Confirmation statement sandbox proof.** On the endpoint CS-H2's answer names: a CompanyDataRequest, a no-change statement, a SIC change, one with `Shareholdings`, one with a blank director code, each polled to a terminal state and pinned in the simulator; settles Q2 and Q3. Blocked on CS-5, CS-7, CS-H1 and CS-H2; machine-ask when it runs (live credentials). **Source**: `PLAN_COMPANIES_HOUSE_CONFIRMATION_STATEMENT.md` (its Tasks table carries the files). **Owner**: Claude Code. **Model**: Sonnet. **Size**: 3 files.

- [ ] **CS-11. Confirmation statement prod launch.** `prod` on the activity, prod gateway values, `COMPANIES_HOUSE_CS_FEE_MODE=operator` wired through `CompaniesHouseStack.java` for the operator's own company (the Lambda reads it but no CDK prop sets it, so operator mode is unreachable when deployed), `compliance.toml` rows for the credit account and the authorisation. Shares BACKLOG 34c steps 3 and 4 with the accounts launch. Blocked on CS-9, CS-H4 and CS-H6. **Source**: `PLAN_COMPANIES_HOUSE_CONFIRMATION_STATEMENT.md` (its Tasks table carries the files). **Owner**: Claude Code. **Model**: Haiku. **Size**: 5 files.

- [ ] **CS-13. PSC verification statement (VS01).** A builder over `PSCVerificationStatement-v1-0.xsd`, a submit and poll Lambda pair, a result-view section for each director who is also a PSC, filed after the statement inside the window starting the day after the review date (the report's V4). Blocked on CS-9. **Source**: `PLAN_COMPANIES_HOUSE_CONFIRMATION_STATEMENT.md` (its Tasks table carries the files). **Owner**: Claude Code. **Model**: Sonnet. **Size**: ~8 files.

- [ ] **CS-H4. Software authorisation for the confirmation statement.** The XML team tests CS-9's submissions and issues the package reference for the form. Blocked on CS-9. **Source**: `PLAN_COMPANIES_HOUSE_CONFIRMATION_STATEMENT.md` (its Tasks table carries the files). **Owner**: Operator. **Model**: none. **Size**: 0 files.

- [ ] **CS-H6. Go for the prod confirmation statement.** Give the go for a second, fee-free statement for 06846849 through Submit in the 2026-27 payment period (the statement for the 2026-09-21 review date went by WebFiling on 2026-09-24, submission 119-158484, accepted), knowing it moves the next review date. Blocked on CS-11 and CS-H4 (the directors' codes are ready). **Source**: `PLAN_COMPANIES_HOUSE_CONFIRMATION_STATEMENT.md` (its Tasks table carries the files). **Owner**: Operator. **Model**: none. **Size**: 0 files.

- [ ] **B30at1. The sweep's claim check, proven.** Needs a claimed set that is not last-known-good
  (the sweep keeps the last-known-good set before it reads any claim): the next time two branches
  deploy at once, `gh workflow run destroy-ci.yml -f sweep-for-stacks=true` while the second holds
  `ci-set2`, and its log shows "stays: claimed by run". Blocked on two branches deploying at once. **Owner**: Claude Code. **Model**: Haiku.
  **Size**: 0 files.

- [ ] **B34.6c. Companies House accounts filing: the sandbox proof.** The XML team was asked on 2026-09-23 22:22 UTC in a new thread (from antony@, subject "Submission 000004 status and
  GetSubmissionStatus query") whether 000004 was accepted and whether lookups are enabled for test
  presenter 66666727000. When the answer says they are: poll 000004 through `GET /api/v1/companies-house/accounts/000004` on a
  standing ci set and pin the returned `StatusCode` and any rejections as a case in
  `app/unit-tests/functions/companiesHouseAccountsGet.test.js`. The prod catalogue listing is
  BACKLOG 34c's: prod carries no `COMPANIES_HOUSE_XMLGW_URI` and no presenter secret ARNs. Blocked
  on the XML team's reply. They asked for the request and response on 2026-09-24; the reply went the same day with transactions 1790285530232 (9999) and 1790285532345 (502), masked (`../DRAFT_EMAIL_XMLGW_000004_REPLY.md`; the unmasked set, from the 21:42 run, is `../DRAFT_EMAIL_XMLGW_000004_REPLY_UNMASKED.md`). In the 9999 response the gateway echoes `Method` CHMD5 with an empty `Value`. **Source**: BACKLOG 34b. **Owner**: Claude Code. **Model**: Sonnet. **Size**:
  ~1 file.

- [ ] **B52l. The optimiser over the raw export.** A notebook over `../analytics/prod/` (pulled by
  `scripts/analytics-pull.sh`, one CSV per view in `app/functions/analytics/rawExportPublish.js`'s
  `VIEW_NAMES` (line 21)): per-block correlations, the block models fitted (linear cost from
  `v_cost_daily`, log-linear funnels from `v_login_to_submission_funnel` and `v_ga4_funnel_daily`,
  Hill curves for spend), levers ranked by effect per unit cost, and the next experiment proposed
  with its predicted effect and interval as a row ready for `experiments.toml`; Bayesian
  optimisation for the continuous knobs and a Thompson-sampling bandit for allocations once
  experiments exist. The model design as a section under `PLAN_ONE_STOP_DASHBOARD.md` D16 first,
  then the notebook, then one line per objective on `web/public/operator/dashboard.html`. Blocked
  until three months of nightly export exist under `exports/prod/`: first written 2026-09-08, so
  the gate is 2026-12-09, checked with `aws --profile submit-prod s3 ls
  s3://prod-env-analytics-lake-<account>/exports/prod/`. **Source**: BACKLOG 52l;
  `PLAN_ONE_STOP_DASHBOARD.md` D16. **Owner**: Claude Code. **Model**: Opus for the models, Sonnet
  for the notebook. **Size**: ~3 files.

- [ ] **B52m. The reinvestment loop.** Trailing income, reserve, budget, return per pound and payback
  as one block on `web/public/operator/dashboard.html`, fed by observations over `v_revenue_daily`
  and `v_cost_vs_target_monthly` in `operatorSnapshotPublish.js`; the reinvestment fraction as a
  lever with the reserve floor (operator, 2026-09-22: the fraction is 20% of trailing income, the
  reserve floor £2,000, one experiment may take at most 10% of the budget unless the operator
  names a larger share for it, and the trailing window is 30 days); paid traffic and article boosts as `experiments.toml` rows with
  on-off or geographic controls; GA4 conversion import from the Ads account, which exists as code
  (`infra/google/ads/ads.toml`: customer `8142685080`, four conversion actions imported from GA4
  events, one Performance Max campaign); the cost-per-session ceiling PU-15 wrote into D17 is the
  starting bid ceiling. Blocked on B52l's fitted models (the return-per-pound figure), the cost
  panel carrying revenue (BACKLOG 43, from 2026-10-02). **Source**: BACKLOG
  52m; `PLAN_ONE_STOP_DASHBOARD.md` D17. **Owner**: Claude Code. **Model**: Sonnet. **Size**: ~3
  files.

- [ ] **O34c. Companies House clears the presenter for live accounts filing.** BACKLOG 34c steps 2 and 3, after B34.6c's sandbox proof: ask the XML team (`xml@companieshouse.gov.uk`) to clear presenter E0000052288 for the live service and issue the live package reference (the test one is 0012); then set the live presenter id, presenter code and `COMPANIES_HOUSE_PACKAGE_REFERENCE` on GitHub's `prod` environment (Settings, Environments, prod), which `deploy-environment.yml` carries into Secrets Manager. Blocked on B34.6c. **Source**: BACKLOG 34c. **Owner**: Operator. **Model**: none. **Size**: 0 files.

- [ ] **B34c. Companies House accounts filing launched on prod.** BACKLOG 34c steps 4 to 6: `CompaniesHouseStack.java` sets the prod values (`COMPANIES_HOUSE_GATEWAY_TEST=false`, the live package reference) instead of leaving them unset; one filing on the prod lane for a company the operator controls, polled to a terminal state; `prod` added to `file-micro-entity-accounts`' `environments` and `resident`'s listing in `web/public/submit.catalogue.toml`, with the activity page and the accounts video no longer calling it a sandbox preview. Blocked on B34.6c and O34c. **Source**: BACKLOG 34c. **Owner**: Claude Code. **Model**: Sonnet. **Size**: ~5 files.

## Discipline

- **Push once per batch of landed tracks, never per track**, and prefer one dispatch that
  proves several things over several dispatches. A push per track turned one batch into six
  ci deploys and several environment deploys in a morning on 2026-09-06, each able to open
  alarm issues and cancel each other through the deploy concurrency group, and the operator
  froze pushes twice. A freeze, when the operator calls one, stops `git push`,
  `gh workflow run` and `gh pr create` until they lift it in their own words; local commits,
  worktree tracks and reading logs continue, and a failed job gets a proposed fix in the reply.
