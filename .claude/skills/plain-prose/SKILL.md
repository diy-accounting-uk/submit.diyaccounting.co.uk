# plain-prose — write plain, human prose; keep the proof out of the shop window

The stock LLM writing voice reads as generic and machine-made. This skill is the standing style
guide for this repo. It has two jobs: make prose read as if a person wrote it, and keep the
supporting evidence out of the way so reader-facing surfaces stay short enough that someone
actually reads them.

**Scope: everything written for a human reader** — `README.md`, the site pages under
`web/public/`, the `PLAN_*.md` design docs, the `REPORT_*.md` and `RUNBOOK_*.md` write-ups, other
skill docs, code comments, and the assistant's own chat responses.

The base rules in section 1 are the Plain English Campaign's, who have promoted plain English and
fought gobbledygook since 1979 (plainenglish.co.uk). Section 2 adds the LLM-voice tells to cut on
top of them.

## 1. Plain English base rules

The foundation. Apply these before worrying about anything else.

- **Short sentences. Average 15–20 words.** Mix short and longer, but if a sentence runs past ~25
  words, split it. One long clause-stacked sentence is the most common wordiness fault.
- **One idea per sentence** (plus perhaps one closely related point). If you are joining two ideas
  with a dash or a semicolon, they usually want to be two sentences.
- **Active voice, not passive.** "The Lambda validates the token," not "the token is validated by
  the Lambda." Passive hides who does what and adds words.
- **Everyday words.** Use the simplest word that fits. Cut jargon a first-time reader can't parse,
  or define it in three words the first time.
- **Write to the reader as "you"; call ourselves "we".** "You run it from the repo root," not "the
  tool is run by the user from the repo root."
- **Cut nominalisations** (an abstract noun hiding a verb). "We discussed it," not "we had a
  discussion about it." "It fails," not "it results in a failure."
- **Use lists** when you have three or more parallel points. A bullet list scans; a comma-spliced
  sentence does not.
- **Cut every word that earns nothing.** Delete redundant openers ("It is important to note that",
  "In order to"), doubled words ("each and every"), and filler adverbs.

Common substitutions (Plain English Campaign's A-to-Z, the ones that recur here):

| instead of | write |
| --- | --- |
| additional | extra |
| commence / initiate | start |
| ensure | make sure |
| in excess of | more than |
| prior to | before |
| subsequent to | after |
| terminate | end |
| utilise | use |
| in order to | to |
| approximately | about |
| demonstrate | show |
| sufficient | enough |
| require | need |
| regarding / with regard to | about |
| whilst | while |
| in the event that | if |

## 2. The LLM-voice tells to cut

On top of the Plain English rules, scan every draft for these machine-voice fingerprints and
remove them.

- **Em-dash sprinkling as fake sophistication.** Do not bolt clauses together with `—`. Use a
  period, a comma, or restructure. Reserve em-dashes for rare, deliberate use.
- **The "not X, it's Y" / "not X but Y" / "not only X but also Y" negation-contrast.** State what
  the thing is, not what it isn't. "The test suite runs in four seconds," not "it is not a slow
  suite."
- **Announced-honesty preambles.** Drop "honest current state:", "to be clear," "reported
  honestly." Just report the thing.
- **Colon reveals.** Avoid the dramatic setup-then-colon. Write a plain subject-verb sentence.
- **Anthropomorphizing tools and pipelines.** A Lambda does not "want," a deployment does not
  "struggle." Say what it did or measured.
- **Rule-of-three padding, hedging, and hype.** Cut "powerful", "seamless", "robust", "in the
  ever-evolving landscape", "it's worth noting", "delve", and the reflexive three-item list where
  one item does the job.
- **Listicle bloat and promotional filler.** Don't inflate two real points into a bulleted five.
  Don't restate the headline three ways. One concrete claim beats three decorated ones.

Default to short declarative sentences a person would write. Say the thing once, plainly.

## 3. Proofs and evidence: keep the shop window short

Reader-facing surfaces (`README.md`, the site pages under `web/public/`) sell the product. They
are not the place to prove every claim. Someone landing on a page wants to know what the product
does and how to use it, before any methodology.

- Lead with what it does and what the reader gets, in one or two short sentences.
- Give the headline fact in a sentence, with the one number or status that matters. Then stop.
- Prefer whitespace and short blocks over dense paragraphs.
- Link out for the proof: point to the relevant `PLAN_*.md`, `REPORT_*.md`, or `RUNBOOK_*.md`
  instead of reproducing its detail.

**Keep the full detail in `REPORT_*.md`** (accessibility, security, incident-bundle, and
repository-contents reports), `RUNBOOK_*.md` (operational procedures), and `PLAN_*.md` (design
detail behind a change in progress). A reader who wants to verify follows the link and finds
everything; a reader who just wants to know what the product does is not made to wade through the
proof.

The rule in one line: **the claim lives in the window, the proof lives in the back room, and a
link connects them.**

## 4. Related principles (same spirit)

- **No delta-framing.** Describe the work on its own terms. Don't frame a change as a rebuttal to
  a prior approach or a competitor. If a test run refuted an approach, report the measurement, not
  a running quarrel with the source.
- **Dependency pragmatism.** Never frame work around avoiding dependencies. State what a choice
  does positively.
- **"NOT" sections stay factual.** A "this repo deliberately does NOT do X" note is fine when each
  bullet states a positive scope decision (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`'s "No 'legacy' support code" rule).
  Keep those grounded; don't let them drift into a list of things competitors get wrong.

All three are the same instinct as this skill: say what the thing is, positively and plainly,
without scaffolding it against something else.

## 5. Workflow — edit before you ship

After drafting any human-facing text:

1. **Cut length first.** Split every sentence over ~25 words. Delete redundant openers and filler.
   Turn a three-plus-point sentence into a list. Run the substitution table over it.
2. **Cut the tells.** Search for `—`, "not just", "not only", "not X, it's Y", "honest"/
   "transparent" self-labels, "delve", "it's worth noting", and hype adjectives. Remove each one.
3. **Read it as a stranger.** If a clause sounds like a press release or a model's default voice,
   rewrite it as the sentence a person would say out loud.
4. **On a reader-facing surface, check the order.** Benefit first, then how to use it, then a
   short claim with a link to the relevant `PLAN_*.md`/`REPORT_*.md`. If methodology arrives
   before benefit, move it.
5. **Match the surrounding voice.** A paragraph that suddenly turns formal and three-adjectived is
   a tell even if every word is fine.

This applies to the assistant's own chat responses too, not only the artefacts it produces.

## 6. One-paragraph TL;DR

Write plain, direct prose a person would recognise as human. Short sentences (15–20 words), one
idea each, active voice, everyday words, "you"/"we", no nominalisations, lists for parallel
points. On top of that, cut the LLM tells: em-dash sprinkling, "not X it's Y", announced-honesty,
colon reveals, anthropomorphized tools, hype, rule-of-three padding, listicle bloat. On
`README.md` and the site pages, lead with the benefit, state the headline fact in a sentence, and
link to the proof instead of reproducing it; the full detail lives in the `REPORT_*.md` and
`RUNBOOK_*.md` write-ups, and the design detail in `PLAN_*.md` docs. Base rules are the Plain
English Campaign's (plainenglish.co.uk). Applies to docs, code comments, site copy, and chat.
